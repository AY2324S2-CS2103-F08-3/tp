### Project: StaffConnect

StaffConnect offers convenience and peace of mind to a struggling student with memory recollection issues. This product allows users to easily identify and connect with educators by providing visual cues alongside contact details, supported by a quick and easy filter system. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort person in staffBook.
  * What it does: allows user to view the persons in a sorted order by a specified attribute. Sort command allows for multiple attribute with specified weightage.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can prioritise and efficiently obtain information in a large dataset.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=whitesnowx&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-02-23&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=whitesnowx&tabRepo=AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
